# WHO'S THAT API!?

## I've taken another interest of mine (Pokemon) to create an API

This API will scrape the web and return an object to the user. You can get your desired pokemon's image, name, pokedex number, type(s), species, and egg groups(s)

The website I am scraping from can be found here: [pokemondb](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/national)

I will be implementing this project into a front end application which can be found here: ----
