# WHO'S. THAT. API!?

## I've taken another interest of mine (Pokemon) to create an API

### This project uses Express and Cheerio

This API will scrape the web and return an object to the user by passing object keys and Cheerio selectors through a function. You can get your desired pokemon's image, name, pokedex number, type(s), species, and egg groups(s) - BUT **only if you have the key**. Email me if you'd like the key!

The website I am scraping from can be found here: [pokemondb](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/national)

I will be implementing this project into a front end application which can be found here: ----
